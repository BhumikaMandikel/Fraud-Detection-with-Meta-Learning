# Fraud-Detection-with-Meta-Learning
This project uses the **Meta-Learning Reptile** algorithm for financial fraud detection. Traditional machine learning models struggle to adapt to dynamic fraud patterns, especially with limited labeled data. By leveraging Reptile, a first-order gradient-based meta-learning algorithm, this approach rapidly adapts to new fraud data, improving detection accuracy and robustness.

## Key Features
- **Meta-Learning with Reptile**: Optimizes model initialization to quickly fine-tune on new fraud datasets.
- **Enhanced Generalization**: Outperforms conventional methods by better generalizing across various fraud scenarios.
- **Scalable and Robust**: Handles evolving fraud patterns with minimal data, making it ideal for real-world deployment in financial systems.
